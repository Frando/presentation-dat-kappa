# Dat and the peer-to-peer web

## Hypercore, Hyperdrive, Kappa databases

---

# Hypercore

A cryptographically secure append only log

---


# Hypercore

- Signed log of messages
- Single writer

<img src='/assets/hypercore1.png' />

---

# Hyperdrive

- File system abstraction on top of hypercores
- Two hypercores per hyperdrive:
    * metadata: trie-based key-value store
    * content: actual file content
- Single writer
- FUSE support

---

# Hyperdrive

```
hypercore (content)
hypercore (metadata)
  hypertrie
    hyperdrive
```

## hypertrie

```
0: (key, value, trieBuffer)
1: (key, value, trieBuffer)
2: (key, value, trieBuffer)
```

Allows to fetch "current state" first


---

# Kappa databases

"Event sourcing"

Process a log of messages and build secondary indexes

---

# Kappa databases

## kappa-core

```
hypercore KEY
hypercore KEY

  multifeed DISCOVERY_KEY

    multifeed-index
     
      kappa-core

        view (map)
```

- "Open by default"
- Very simple architecture

---

# Kappa databases

### Challenges

- History is not free
- Unordered delivery of messages
- Managing adding/removing sources

---

### Kappa on top of hypertrie/hyperdrive

- Use trie structure to fetch present before history
- Manage both records and files
